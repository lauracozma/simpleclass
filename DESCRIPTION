Description: Images of handwritten digits are used to train a simple kNN classifier. Each observation is 16x16 pixel grayscale image which is represented in a single row as 256 features. Each of 256 pixels is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location in the image. True label is at a first position in a row, it identifies which digit is represented in a row with an integer from 0 to 9.
